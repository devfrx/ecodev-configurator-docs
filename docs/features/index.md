  ├── guides
  │   ├── installation.md
  │   └── usage.md
  ├── api
  │   ├── index.md
  │   └── endpoints.md
  └── index.md
```

- **/docs**: The main directory containing all documentation files.
- **/getting-started**: Contains introductory guides for new users.
- **/components**: Documentation for reusable components within the project.
- **/guides**: Detailed guides on installation and usage.
- **/api**: API documentation, including endpoints and usage examples.
- **index.md**: The main entry point for the documentation.

## Functions

The EcoDev Configurator provides several key functions:

- **User Interface Components**: A set of reusable UI components to enhance user experience.
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with external APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecodev-configurator-docs.git
   cd ecodev-configurator-docs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure VitePress**:
   Ensure that your `vitepress` configuration is set up correctly in the `.vitepress` directory.

## Viewing the Documentation

To view the documentation locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This will start a local development server, and you can view the documentation in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Launching the Project

To build and launch the project for production, use the following commands:

1. **Build the Documentation**:
   ```bash
   npm run docs:build
   ```

2. **Serve the Built Documentation**:
   You can serve the built documentation using a static server. For example, you can use `serve`:
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   serve docs/.vitepress/dist
   ```
